            History
            Damongo traces its roots back to the ancient Songhai Empire<br> and their migration to present-day Ghana in 1546, led by Askia Mohammed.<br> Rulers of the time, such as Musa Askia, Landa, Wam, Amoah, and Lanta Limu,<br> paved the way for the establishment of the modern Gonja Kingdom.<br>
            
            The seat of the Gonja Kingdom was moved from Nyange to Damongo by Yagbonwura Awusi Ewuntomah Bunyangso,<br> who ruled from 1942 to 1975. At that time,<br> Damongo was a small community with less than ten households.<br> Nevertheless, it became the focal point of Gonja's leadership and heritage.<br>
            
            During the colonial era,<br> Damongo played a vital role as an administrative center for the colonial government.<br> Its strategic location facilitated communication and trade between the northern and southern parts of the country.<br>

            Although Damongo is classified as urban, much of its population still heavily relies on agriculture.<br> The primary crops cultivated include cash crops such as corn, millet, yams, okra, and groundnuts.<br> In some regions of Damongo, upland rice is also grown.<br>
            Additionally, shea nuts are sourced from wild trees,<br> and they serve both as a food source and as raw material for<br> the production of oils and cosmetics through refinement processes.<br> The traditional agricultural practices and cultivation of these crops continue to play<br> a vital role in the community's sustenance and economic activities.<br>

    </b>
    There is a lot of problems plaguing the town,<br> preventing further development in the region.<br>
    Water crisis also known as <b>"Ntu Munta" </b>a famous sentence in the city.<br>
    Damongo (and surrounding areas) have been dealing with access to clean water since being settled.<br> Residents have resorted to hand digging wells and boreholes included with hand pumps to receive water.<br> The district, with help from the Government of Ghana plans to begin work on a water system that<br> would provide safe drinking water to the whole community.<br> Lack of infrastructure
    The lack of proper infrastructure has led to an increase in crime in the town<br> and a lack of protection to floods.<br> The increase in crime could be blame for the lack of functioning street lights,<br> which is leading to a increase in car crashes.<br>
