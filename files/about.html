    The Mole National Park is located in the Savannah region, precisely 24km away from Damongo.<br>
    Mole has an important history linked to the national slave trade route project.<br> The ancient caravan route from Salaga to Wa and beyond to Mali,<br> passed through the heart of the park.<br> This route was used for both trading and to transport slaves to coastal markets.
