                <p>The park's lands were set aside as a wildlife refuge in 1958.<br> In 1971, the small human population of the area was relocated and the lands were designated to a national park.<br> The park has not seen major development as a tourist location since its original designation. <br>The Mole National park as a protective area is underfunded and national and<br> international concerns exist about poaching and sustainability in the park,<br> but its protection of important resident antelope species has improved since its initial founding as a preserve.<br>
    
                    Since the resettlement of humans from the area,<br> the park has become an important study area for scientists.<br> This has allowed for some long-term studies, in particular,<br> of relatively undisturbed sites compared to similar areas of densely populated equatorial West Africa.<br> One study on the resident population of 800 elephants,<br> for example, indicates that elephant damage to large trees varies with species.<br> In Mole, elephants have a greater tendency to seriously injure economically important species such as Burkea africana,<br> an important tropical hardwood, and Butyrospermum paradoxum,<br> the source of shea butter, over the less important Terminalia spp.<br>
                    
                    Recently, honey made from flowers in the Mol√© National Forest has become the region's first fair-trade commodity.<br> Nearby, villagers harvest the honey using traditional,<br> non-invasive methods,<br> and have partnered with a Utah-based company to sell the honey as a health and wellness supplement in the US.<br> The program was co-founded by Ashanti Chief Nana Kwasi Agyemang,<br> who hopes to re-ignite local interest in the honey and eventually export it to other countries in Africa.<br></p>
